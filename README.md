# Reinforcement Learning of Air Traffic Control Tasks
## Project Proposition
The goal is to train a neural network to perform basic Air Traffic Control Tasks through reinforcement learning. 

Air traffic control (ATC) is a service provided by ground-based air traffic controllers who direct aircraft on the 
ground and through controlled airspace, and can provide advisory services to aircraft in non-controlled airspace. [1][1]

One ATC task is approach control, which is the job of directing aircraft which are approaching an airport onto the 
final approach course at the correct altitude and within a 45 degree arc of the final approach course.
